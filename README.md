## How much have I made with bitcoins?
Bitcoins is a super-simple command-line software that shows you how much money you have made each time you sold some bitcoins.

**Notice**: bitcoins does not allow you to trade, nor does it do it automatically for you.
You still need to do your bitcoin trades in an exchange such as [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) or [SatoshiTango](https://satoshitango.com/home).

### How to Install

Currently you need to have nodejs and npm installed before you can use bitcoins.
NPM comes bundled with nodejs, so you just need to [download and install the latest version of nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Afterwards, run the following command on the terminal to install bitcoins:

`npm i -g bitcoins`

### How to Use

Simply run `bitcoins` in the terminal.

Bitcoins will display a table with all your bitcoin purchases and sales followed by some overall data.

The first time you run it it will ask you to locate the file where you store your bitcoin transactions.
